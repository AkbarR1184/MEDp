This repository focuses on the intensifying hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean, a climate hotspot highly sensitive to global warming. While extensive research has been conducted, high-resolution studies examining the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation patterns across the entire region remain limited. This analysis covers trends in total precipitation, wet days, daily intensity, and quantile-based precipitation intensities using ten datasets from 2001 to 2019: E-OBS, EM-EARTH, ERA5-Land, GPM-IMERG, GSMaP, GPCP, GPCC, MERRA2-Land, MSWEP, and MSWX.
